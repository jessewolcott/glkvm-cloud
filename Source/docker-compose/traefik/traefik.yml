# Traefik Static Configuration for GLKVM Cloud
# =============================================
# This configuration enables:
# - Automatic Let's Encrypt certificates (including wildcard)
# - DNS-01 challenge via DigitalOcean
# - Access logging for CrowdSec integration
# - HTTP to HTTPS redirection
#
# Environment variables (DOMAIN, ACME_EMAIL, DO_AUTH_TOKEN) are
# passed via docker-compose and used in container labels for routing.
